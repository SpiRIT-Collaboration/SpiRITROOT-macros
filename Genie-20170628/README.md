# Macros and cuts for generating the plots by Genie

All plots are generated from a single ROOT file containing all the information in a single tree,
which makes the plotting time short and easy to handle the cuts.

That single ROOT file is generated by `dedxSn132.C` macro file.
It reads in all the reco files from SpiRITROOT as well as **refined** beam analysis data.
**Refined** beam analysis data files are created by `refine_beam.C` macro.

So, here's the flow.
1. Reconstruction of TPC data.
1. Analysis of the beam data.
1. Serializing the beam analysis data using `refine_beam.C`.
1. Serializing all the data combining both TPC and **refined** beam data using `dedxSn132.C`.
   - `dedxSn132.C` also reads in two ROOT files, `pdFuncCut.root` and `pionCut.root`.
1. Now that you have the single ROOT file containing all the information, you can run `drawpTVSy.C` and `drawpTVSy_pi.C` to generate pT vs rapidity plots.
1. To apply the multiplicity cut, or run `drawpTVSy_proton_multCut.C`, you have to create the ROOT file containing multiplicity information. That is done by running `makeMultiplicity.C` macro.
